## ðŸŽ¯ Model Inference
To test out the model in real-time, you can upload images on the RoboFlow website where the model is hosted for real-time object detection. 
### [Model Inference: ](https://app.roboflow.com/yolov8-rmfc1/football-player-tracker-ghdyd/visualize/1)

## Hosted API
To run inference through Roboflow API using Python, use the roboflow Python package:
```
# import the inference-sdk
from inference_sdk import InferenceHTTPClient

# initialize the client
CLIENT = InferenceHTTPClient(
    api_url="https://detect.roboflow.com",
    api_key="API_KEY"
)

# infer on a local image
result = CLIENT.infer("YOUR_IMAGE.jpg", model_id="football-player-tracker-ghdyd/1")

```
